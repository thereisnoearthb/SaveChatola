    <p>The District Magistrate, Nainital</p>

    <p><strong>Subject: Request to take immediate and stringent action against the Illegal destruction of playground, walking path and water tank by a builder</strong> in <strong>Village Chatola, P.O. Mukteshwar, Nainital,Uttarakhand.</strong></p>
    <p>Sir,</p>
    <p>This is with reference to the above-mentioned subject matter. There have been various confirmed reports of an illegal destruction of a playground, walking path and water tank by a builder in <strong>Village Chatola,P.O.Mukteshwar, Nainital,Uttarakhand.</strong> The builder has illegally encroached upon the sole public playing field in Village Chatola. The field was developed on Gram Sabha Land to create a playing field with Government Funds under the PYKKA&nbsp;scheme, from the GOI, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.amarujala.com/uttarakhand/nainital/nainital1626004930">https://www.amarujala.com/uttarakhand/nainital/nainital1626004930</a></p>
    <p>The builder has also demolished part of a 100 year old village path reducing it to less than half its width and making it dangerous and vulnerable to collapse.&nbsp;The path was being used by school children, residents, local villagers, cattle and horses that carried loads and was the only approach to some homes.</p>
    <p>This path connects several villages, starting from Seetla, passing through Chatola, and proceeds onwards to Satkhol, Satoli, Sonapani and Naulikhan. The supervisor of the builders JCB operations, a local resident living adjacent to the village path, has diverted the village path and encroached upon Govt land. Further, they have also illegally demolished a 70 year old village water tank.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The youth who used this field to prepare for competitive cricket at block, district and state level, now have nowhere to practice. In a zone where there is acute water shortage and perennial naulas are drying up, a 70 year old traditional water tank has been illegally destroyed.</p>

    <p>The JCB supervisor has grabbed village/Government/ forest land and the Gram Pradhan and offices of the District Magistrate, District Forest Officer have remained silent on a petition received by them on 21st June 2021 despite written complaints, protests and media reports.</p>

    <p>It is requested that strict and immediate action be initiated against the culprits, and, they be directed to restore the paidal marg, water tank and playing field to their original dimensions at the exact same locations on which they were.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Further, a departmental enquiry needs to be conducted on an urgent basis as to how Government land can be encroached upon like this and there is no resulting action from the concerned authorities.</p>
    <p>Sincerely</p>
